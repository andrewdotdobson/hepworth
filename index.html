            <h1>Hepworth's string - an emulation</h1>
            <img src="img/hep.jpg" alt="hepworth detail" />
            <p>Below is a programmatic response to the <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/barbara-hepworth-sculpture-modern-world?gclid=CMjLkqnoqccCFQ3ItAod4EsN6Q">Barbara Hepworth exhibition</a> currently at the Tate Britain.  I've always been struck with the similarities between Hepworth's forms and the mathematical models which I used to look at in the Science Museum as a kid.  The recent retrospective of Hepworth's works at the Tate makes quite a point of <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/maths-reform/9180688/Numeracy-campaign-art-and-maths-on-show.html">this influence</a>. String being pulled between points along the curve and the barely tangible geometry which results.  Curves and lines suggested by the intersection of straight lines. I got home tonight and wanted to try to code something to emulate it.  The below is a very simple response to the work, to be developed more fully to incorporate the kind of arced lines which Hepworth utilises in her forms.  I just wanted to get this out of my system first!
